1. Main objective of Docker is to make it easy to install any software on any computer/server without worrying about setup or dependencies.
2. Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers. When we want to install a program, we grab an "Image" (a single file with all the deps and config required to run a program) from the source. The image can then be run on a "Container" (Instance of an image which runs the program). Docker Ecosystem includes:
<ol>
<li><b>Docker Client</b>: (Docker CLI) Tool that we use to issue commands to.</li>
<li><b>Docker Server</b>: (Docker Daemon) Tool that is responsible for creating images, running containers etc.</li>
<li><b>Docker Machine</b>: </li>
<li><b>Docker Images</b>: </li>
<li><b>Docker Hub</b>: </li>
<li><b>Docker Compose</b>: </li>
</ol>
